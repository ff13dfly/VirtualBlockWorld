## Issue

VBC adopts the mechanism of issuing with the world, that is, each block issue 100 VBCs at the same time. In this way, we can see that the VBC is an inflation model. With the issuance of the world, the increase of the total amount of tokens slows down, which is very similar to the real world.

VBC can be circulated in different worlds, which is a great challenge to King's management. It will dynamically balance the relationship between different worlds.

 For example, the construction of world 0 is very good, the price of block rises, and VBC flows into this world, which leads to the devaluation of block in world 1. However, the low price of devaluation attracts players to enter, and VBC flows in again. Balance the relationship between different worlds through the way of players' independent use.
